      3 network layer      : in network layer router take place with using ip address which find best convinient and fastest path to travel data in shorter time its use 2 protocals (RIP) routing information protocal and (OSPF) open shortest path finder  
      4 transport layer    : transport layer were decide which protocal is use tcp or udp its its contaion ports also 
      5 session layer      : session layer is a layer 5 which create session between sender and reciving it is istablish connection its responsible for maintain connectivty session layer id or password or session id
