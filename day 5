DAY 5 packet and frame 
  1) first of all we know about packet and frame where the  both are the small data part which after a encode and get full data as like one data devide into small same part to fast transfer packet use layer 3 or frame layer 2

      - tcp/ip advantage and disadvantage 
       - advantage 
        Perfect! Let’s break TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) down in a simple, clear way — advantages and disadvantages.

🔹 TCP Advantages ✅

Reliable Delivery

TCP ensures all packets arrive complete and in order.

Lost packets are retransmitted automatically.

Connection-Oriented

Establishes a connection before sending data (3-way handshake).

Ensures both sender and receiver are ready.

Flow Control

Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver.

Uses windowing mechanism.

Error Detection & Correction

Each segment has checksum.

Errors are detected and corrected via retransmission.

Segmentation and Reassembly

Large data is broken into smaller segments.

Receiver reassembles them in order.

Multiplexing

Multiple applications can share one connection using port numbers.


  
  
  
  🔹 TCP Disadvantages ❌

Slower than UDP

Due to reliability checks, flow control, and handshake overhead.

Overhead

TCP headers are larger (20 bytes minimum), adds extra bits to each segment.

Connection Setup Required

3-way handshake adds latency before data transfer starts.

Resource Intensive

Needs memory and processing at both ends to track connections and state.

🔹 Quick Memory Trick


      - tcp 3 way handshake  tcp 3 way hand shake use to connect a secure connection between sender and reciver its use thats various flags like syn,ack,fin,res,data







    3) #udp/ip   udp ip is the same transport layer protocal where the data tranfer using user datagram protocall its for a brodcasting and multicasting the data he,s not matter data is reciving or not its not reliable for a importante data its use in
               like data like video streaming its not check tha data intigrity like tcp/ip 



               # udp/ip headesrs  

                  1) time to live 
                  2) source address 
                  3) destination address
                  4) source port 
                  5) destination port 
                  6) data 

                       # advantage and disadvantage of udp ip 

        🔹 UDP (User Datagram Protocol) Advantages ✅
Lightweight / Low Overhead

UDP header is only 8 bytes → fast transmission.
Faster than TCP

No connection setup (3-way handshake)
No retransmissions → suitable for real-time apps.
Supports Broadcasting / Multicasting

Can send packets to multiple hosts at once.
Simple

Easy to implement
Good for small query-response protocols (DNS, DHCP)

🔹 UDP Disadvantages ❌
Unreliable

No guarantee that data reaches the destination.
No Ordering

Packets may arrive out of order.
No Flow Control / Congestion Control

Sender can overwhelm receiver → packet loss possible.
Error Handling Minimal

Only optional checksum → errors may go undetected
